Hello,

This is the copy of a link on How to Write a Git Commit Message:

https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

As a rule of thumb, a properly formed Git commit subject line should always be
able to complete the following sentence:

- If applied, this commit will "your subject line here"

For example:
If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch

Notice how this doesn’t work for the other non-imperative forms:

If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods
Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you’re writing the body.
